\textbf{2.} They will allow members to consistently make decisions with the organization’s best interests in mind.

\textbf{3.} They will refocus our organization towards achieving our mission and vision.

This amendment proposes the addition of Section 3 to Article II as the following:

\subsubsection{Section 3}

We, the members of Blueprint shall be upheld to the following organizational values. These values further embody our mission and vision, determine how we make decisions, and reflect how we behave and act, collectively and individually.

Mission First:

We as Blueprint members ultimately unify under one goal -  achieving our mission. We place the interests of the people and clients we serve above our own. Our primary measure of success is the amount of positive impact we create through our work.

Perpetual Growth:

We as Blueprint members value the academic, social, and personal growth of our peers. We constantly seek to perpetuate the cycle of learning and teaching, for our benefit and for others’. We strive to offer a helping hand in times of need and push each other to succeed.

Cherish Culture:

We as Blueprint members seek to not only enjoy our work, but also cherish our time spent together. Inside and outside of our projects, we develop long-lasting friendships that extend well beyond the scope of the organization. 

Innovate:

We as Blueprint members recognize that change is both inevitable and necessary. We are committed to innovate and emphasize effective solutions as needed in order to remain relevant - nothing is sacred. We welcome new ideas and diverse thinking.

Stay Humble:

We as Blueprint members dedicate ourselves to volunteering for the sake of doing good. In the face of success, we maintain humility - we recycle our pride to fuel our constant pursuit of our mission. We remember that social good is for anyone and everyone, not just Blueprint.
